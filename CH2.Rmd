## Statistical Inference

Statistical inference is used to learn from incomplete or imperfect data.

This class sets up regression models using a measurement-error philosophy
$$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \epsilon,$$
where the errors are considered to be a random sample from a probability distribution, (e.g. $\epsilon \sim N(0,\sigma^2)$).
